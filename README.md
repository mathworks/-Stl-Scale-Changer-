# STL Scale Changer 

[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks/Stl-Resolution-Reducer)

The STL Scale Changer streamlines the process of directly changing the scale of STL files within a specified folder. For instance, it facilitates easy unit conversion from millimeters to meters. 

By enabling users to select a folder, choose an STL file, and adjust its scale, this tool allows for the proper sizing of STL files in simulation environments such as Robotics System Toolbox&trade; of MATLAB&reg;. The functionality to overwrite the original STL file ensures the integrity of the project is maintained without the need for manual adjustments.
